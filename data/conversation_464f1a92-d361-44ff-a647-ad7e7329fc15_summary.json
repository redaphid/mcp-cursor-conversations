      "text": "\n\nI've updated the shader to better align with the requirements. Here are the key changes made:\n\n1. Moved all audio feature references to #define statements at the top with clear comments about their purpose:\n   - PROBE_A: Color blend factor using spectral kurtosis\n   - PROBE_B: Pattern evolution using spectral centroid\n   - PROBE_C: Movement speed using energy\n   - PROBE_D: Scale factor using bass\n   - PROBE_E: Texture detail using spectral roughness\n   - PROBE_F: Color intensity using spectral flux\n\n2. Improved audio reactivity by:\n   - Using normalized and z-score values appropriately\n   - Adding more dynamic range to color transitions\n   - Making the pattern evolution more responsive to audio features\n   - Enhancing beat detection effects\n\n3. Optimized visual quality by:\n   - Ensuring smooth transitions between states\n   - Maintaining constant visual interest through layered effects\n   - Avoiding harsh transitions or solid color areas\n   - Adding more organic movement through the audio-reactive parameters\n\n4. Added comments to clarify the purpose of each PROBE definition\n\nThe shader now better follows the requirements while maintaining its core melted satin aesthetic. Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to specific aspects of the visualization?",
