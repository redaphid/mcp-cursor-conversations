      "text": "Let me analyze the `isRelativeEncoder` function to identify its issues.\n\nThe function is trying to detect if a MIDI control is a relative encoder by looking at patterns in the values it receives. Here are the problems:\n\n1. The logic is incomplete - it cuts off in the middle of the function (there's no closing brace)\n\n2. The detection algorithm has flaws:\n   - It only considers values that are < 10 or > 120 as potential relative encoders\n   - It increments a counter when values are equal and in those ranges\n   - It decrements the counter when values change\n   - It decides something is a relative encoder if the counter exceeds 5\n\nThe main issues with this approach are:\n\n1. **Too Restrictive Range**: Real relative encoders often use the full range of values (0-127), not just the extremes. The current logic would miss many valid relative encoders.\n\n2. **False Positives**: If a regular knob happens to stay at the same value in those ranges, it could be falsely detected as a relative encoder.\n\n3. **Slow Detection**: The counter-based approach means it takes multiple identical values before detection, which could lead to poor initial user experience.\n\n4. **No Pattern Recognition**: Relative encoders typically follow specific patterns (like small increments/decrements around certain values) which this code doesn't look for.\n\nLet me propose an improved version:",

The code is also more maintainable with clear comments explaining the detection strategy.",

Added `isExtreme` check that looks for values \u2264 10 or \u2265 117, which typically indicate fast turning of a relative encoder\n3. Made the detection even faster for extreme values (only requires 2 confirmations) since these are very strong indicators of relative encoder behavior\n4. Kept the center and wraparound detection as these are still valid indicators\n\nThis should better match the actual behavior of relative encoders, where fast turning produces values at the extremes rather than small incremental changes. The detection should now be more accurate and responsive, especially during fast turning movements.",
