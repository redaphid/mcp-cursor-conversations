      "text": "Let me analyze the service worker code to explain why it's not truly offline-first.\n\nIn a proper offline-first approach, the service worker would typically:\n1. Pre-cache critical assets during installation\n2. Check the cache FIRST and return cached content immediately\n3. Only fetch from network if cache miss or for updates\n\nLooking at the code, there are a few issues that make it not offline-first:\n\n1. No precaching during installation:\n```javascript\nself.addEventListener('install', (event) => {\n    // Immediately activate the new service worker\n    event.waitUntil(self.skipWaiting())\n})\n```\nThe install event doesn't cache any critical assets - it just skips waiting to activate.\n\n2. In the `fetchWithControlledRetry` function, while it does check the cache, the network fetch starts immediately in parallel:\n```javascript\n// Start network fetch immediately\nconst networkPromise = fetch(request)\n```\n\n3. Most importantly, the cache is only used as a fallback when:\n- The network is slow (timeout after 5 seconds)\n- The network request fails\n- There's an error with the network response\n\nThis is more of a \"network-first with cache fallback\" strategy rather than offline-first. In a true offline-first approach, you would:\n1. Return cached content immediately if available\n2. Only then attempt to update the cache from the network\n3. Have a clear strategy for precaching essential resources during installation\n\nTo make this truly offline-first, you would want to:\n1. Add precaching of critical assets in the install event\n2. Modify `fetchWithControlledRetry` to check and return from cache first before attempting network\n3. Use the network response to update the cache in the background for next time\n\nWould you like me to show you how to modify this code to make it properly offline-first?",

Return cached content immediately if available\n2. Update the cache in the background\n3. Only go to the network if absolutely necessary\n4. Handle offline scenarios gracefully\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?",
