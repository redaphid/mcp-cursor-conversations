      "text": "Looking at the service worker code, there are a couple of potential issues that could cause page loading delays:\n\n1. The main issue is in `fetchWithRetry()` - it retries **indefinitely** with an exponential backoff when a request fails. This means if one resource is unavailable, it will keep retrying forever without giving up.\n\n2. The `fetchWithCache()` function always returns the cached response if available, but continues fetching in the background. This is good for performance but the infinite retry could still cause issues.\n\nHere's how we can improve it:\n\n```javascript:paper-cranes/service-worker.js\n// Add a max retry count and timeout\nasync function fetchWithRetry(request) {\n    let interval = 150\n    let attempts = 0\n    const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3\n    const MAX_TIMEOUT = 10000 // 10 seconds\n\n    while (attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {\n        try {\n            const controller = new AbortController()\n            const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), MAX_TIMEOUT)\n            \n            const response = await fetch(request, { signal: controller.signal })\n            clearTimeout(timeoutId)\n            \n            if (response.ok) return response\n            if (response.status === 0 && response.type !== \"error\") return response\n\n            console.warn(\n                `Fetch failed for url ${request.url} (status: ${response.status}), attempt ${attempts + 1}/${MAX_ATTEMPTS}`\n            )\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.warn(`Network error for url ${request.url}, attempt ${attempts + 1}/${MAX_ATTEMPTS}`, error)\n            if (error.name === 'AbortError') {\n                console.warn(`Request timed out after ${MAX_TIMEOUT}ms`)\n                break\n            }\n        }\n\n        attempts++\n        if (attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {\n            await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, interval))\n            const jitter = Math.random() * 100\n            interval = Math.min(interval * (1.5 + jitter), 10000 + jitter * 10)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If all retries fail, return a cached response if available, otherwise fail gracefully\n    const cache = await caches.open(CACHE_NAME)\n    const cachedResponse = await cache.match(request)\n    if (cachedResponse) {\n        console.log(`Returning stale cached response for ${request.url} after all retries failed`)\n        return cachedResponse\n    }\n    \n    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${request.url} after ${MAX_ATTEMPTS} attempts`)\n}\n```\n\nThe key improvements are:\n\n1. Added a maximum retry count (3 attempts)\n2. Added a timeout (10 seconds) for each fetch attempt\n3. If all retries fail, it will:\n   - Return a cached version if available (stale content is better than no content)\n   - Otherwise fail with an error instead of retrying forever\n\nThis should prevent the service worker from getting stuck in an infinite retry loop for a single resource, which could block or delay other resources from loading.\n\nThe changes ensure that:\n- Failed requests will give up after a reasonable time\n- Users won't be stuck waiting indefinitely for non-critical resources\n- The page can still load and function even if some resources are temporarily unavailable",

      "text": "Yes, that's exactly what's happening. The current implementation has a somewhat deceptive pattern:\n\n```javascript\nreturn new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {\n    while (true) {\n        if (interval > 15000) reject(new Error(\"Failed to fetch\")) // but keep going.\n        // ... retry logic continues ...\n    }\n})\n```\n\nThe `reject()` call is essentially meaningless because:\n1. The code continues executing after the reject (due to the comment \"but keep going\")\n2. The Promise executor function continues running in an infinite loop\n3. The rejection is never actually handled since the function continues trying to resolve\n\nThis means that even though it appears to give up after 15 seconds (when interval > 15000), it actually continues retrying forever. This could indeed cause page loading issues since failed requests will never truly terminate.\n\nHere's how it should be fixed:\n\n```javascript:paper-cranes/service-worker.js\nasync function fetchWithRetry(request) {\n    let interval = 150\n    const MAX_RETRY_TIME = 15000\n\n    while (interval <= MAX_RETRY_TIME) {\n        try {\n            const response = await fetch(request)\n            if (response.ok) return response\n            if (response.status === 0 && response.type !== \"error\") return response\n\n            console.warn(\n                `Fetch failed for url ${request.url} (status: ${response.status}), retrying in ${interval}ms...`\n            )\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.warn(`Network error for url ${request.url}, retrying in ${interval}ms...`, error)\n        }\n\n        await timeout(interval)\n        const jitter = Math.random() * 100\n        interval = Math.min(interval * (1.5 + jitter), 10000 + jitter * 10)\n    }\n\n    // Actually give up after MAX_RETRY_TIME\n    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${request.url} after ${MAX_RETRY_TIME}ms`)\n}\n```\n\nThis version:\n1. Actually stops retrying after the max retry time is reached\n2. Properly throws an error that can be caught by the caller\n3. Won't keep consuming resources with infinite retries\n4. Is more honest about its behavior\n\nThe caller (`fetchWithCache`) can then handle the failure appropriately by falling back to cached content if available.",
