Specifically, this line:\n\n```javascript\nnew Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(`Worker ${this.workerName} timed out`)), this.timeout)).catch(() => {\n```\n\nThis line creates a new Promise that:\n1. Will automatically reject after `this.timeout` milliseconds (defined in the constructor, default 50ms)\n2. When it rejects, it throws an error saying which worker timed out\n3. The `.catch()` block then handles this rejection by:\n   - Clearing the resolve handler if this is still the current message\n   - Returning the last known good message instead of failing completely\n\nThis is a common pattern for handling timeouts in async operations. If the worker doesn't respond within the timeout period, instead of failing completely, it falls back to using the last known good value. This helps prevent the visualization from breaking if a worker occasionally takes too long to process data.\n\nThe line is racing against the other promise that would be resolved when the worker actually responds, so whichever happens first (worker response or timeout) will determine the outcome.",
