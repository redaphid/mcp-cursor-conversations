Here's what I've added:\n\n1. **Search Input Component**:\n   - Created a new `SearchInput` component with a text input and a clear button\n   - The clear button only appears when there's text in the input\n   - Added styling to make it look clean and modern\n\n2. **Filtering Logic**:\n   - Added a `filterText` state to the main `List` component\n   - Enhanced the `MusicVisual` component to accept a `filterText` prop\n   - Added filtering logic that checks if the shader name or any preset parameters match the filter text\n   - Implemented a `filteredPresets` state that updates when the filter text changes\n\n3. **Conditional Rendering**:\n   - Shaders that don't match the filter (and don't have any matching presets) are not rendered\n   - When filtering, only the matching presets are shown\n   - When no filter is applied, all shaders and presets are displayed\n\n4. **Styling**:\n   - Added CSS for the search input and clear button\n   - Made the input responsive with a max-width\n   - Added subtle animations and focus states for better UX\n\nThe filter works in real-time as the user types, providing immediate feedback. It searches through both shader names and preset parameters, making it easy to find specific shaders or presets with particular settings.\n\nIs there anything specific about the filter functionality you'd like me to explain or modify?",

Mobile-First Design Without Media Queries\n\nI've completely redesigned the CSS to be mobile-first by default:\n\n- Removed almost all media queries, keeping only one for the grid layout on larger screens\n- Set all font sizes, padding, and margins to be appropriate for mobile by default\n- Made all clickable elements large enough for comfortable touch interaction (min-height: 3.5-4rem)\n- Increased font sizes across the board (base 20px, headers 1.5rem, links 1.3rem)\n- Added proper spacing and visual hierarchy for mobile viewing\n\n### 2. Responsive Layout with Flexbox/Grid\n\n- Used flexbox for the main list layout\n- Added a single media query to switch to a grid layout for presets on larger screens\n- Made the main container fluid with a max-width constraint\n- Improved spacing and alignment for all screen sizes\n- Added proper border-radius and visual styling for all elements\n\n### 3. URL Parameter-Based Filtering\n\nI've added support for filtering via URL parameters:\n\n- The filter is now stored in the URL as `?filter=yourSearchTerm`\n- When you load the page with a filter parameter, it will automatically apply that filter\n- As you type in the search box, the URL updates in real-time (using history.replaceState)\n- Clearing the filter removes the parameter from the URL\n- This allows you to share direct links to filtered results\n\n### 4. Enhanced Visual Design\n\n- Improved contrast and readability\n- Added proper spacing between elements\n- Made chips more visible (increased opacity to 0.7)\n- Added background to chip lists for better readability\n- Improved button and link styling with proper border-radius\n\nThe page now works great on mobile devices by default, with large touch targets and readable text, while still looking good on larger screens thanks to the responsive layout. The filtering functionality is now shareable via URL, allowing you to link directly to filtered results.",

Simplified Mobile-First Design\n\n- **Ultra-simple layout**: Each shader and preset is now a large, easily tappable button\n- **High contrast**: Dark background (#000) with bright text for maximum readability\n- **Larger touch targets**: All clickable elements are at least 44px tall (iOS minimum)\n- **Reduced visual noise**: Removed decorative elements and focused on functionality\n- **Clearer hierarchy**: Shaders are clearly separated from presets\n\n### 2. Optimized for Quick Scanning\n\n- **Shader names**: Cyan color (#0ff) to stand out against the dark background\n- **Preset names**: White text on dark background for clear visibility\n- **Minimal spacing**: Compact layout for seeing more items at once\n- **Simple dividers**: Thin line separators between shader sections\n- **Reduced visual clutter**: Only showing essential information\n\n### 3. Easy Interaction\n\n- **Large tap targets**: The entire button area is clickable, not just the text\n- **Copy buttons**: Positioned consistently on the left for easy access\n- **Edit links**: Hidden on mobile to avoid accidental taps, visible on desktop\n- **Clear visual feedback**: Active states for all interactive elements\n- **Simplified parameters**: Parameter chips are smaller and more compact\n\n### 4. Responsive Design\n\n- **Mobile-first**: Designed primarily for mobile with a single media query for desktop\n- **Edit links**: Only appear on screens wider than 768px\n- **Increased padding**: More breathing room on larger screens\n- **Larger headings**: Better readability on desktop\n\n### 5. Technical Improvements\n\n- **Simplified HTML structure**: Removed nested divs and simplified the component structure\n- **Improved event handling**: Added preventDefault to button clicks to avoid navigation issues\n- **Hide empty chip lists**: Now returns null if there are no parameters to show\n- **URL parameter filtering**: Maintained the ability to link directly to filtered results\n\nThis design prioritizes simplicity and usability in a busy, dark environment, making it easy to quickly scan through the list and tap on the desired shader or preset. The copy button is always accessible, and the edit link only appears when there's enough screen space.",

      "text": "I've completely refactored the CSS using semantic variables, making it much easier to adjust the styling in a consistent way. Here's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n### CSS Variables Structure\n\nI've organized the variables into logical categories:\n\n1. **Colors**\n   - `--color-background`: Main background color\n   - `--color-surface`: Primary surface color for elements\n   - `--color-surface-highlight`: Secondary surface color for highlighted elements\n   - `--color-border`: Border color\n   - `--color-text-primary`: Main text color\n   - `--color-text-secondary`: Secondary text color for less important content\n   - `--color-accent`: Primary accent color (cyan)\n   - `--color-accent-secondary`: Secondary accent color (magenta)\n   - `--color-success`: Color for success states\n\n2. **Typography**\n   - `--font-size-base`: Base font size\n   - `--font-size-small`: Small text size\n   - `--font-size-large`: Large text size\n   - `--font-size-xl`: Extra large text size\n   - `--font-weight-normal`: Normal font weight\n   - `--font-weight-bold`: Bold font weight\n   - `--line-height`: Base line height\n\n3. **Spacing**\n   - `--spacing-xs`: Extra small spacing (5px)\n   - `--spacing-sm`: Small spacing (10px)\n   - `--spacing-md`: Medium spacing (15px)\n   - `--spacing-lg`: Large spacing (20px)\n   - `--spacing-xl`: Extra large spacing (40px)\n\n4. **Layout**\n   - `--border-radius-sm`: Small border radius\n   - `--border-radius-md`: Medium border radius\n   - `--border-radius-circle`: Circle border radius\n   - `--container-width`: Maximum container width\n\n5. **Component-specific**\n   - `--button-size`: Size for buttons\n   - `--icon-size`: Size for icons\n   - `--input-padding`: Padding for input fields\n   - `--item-padding`: Padding for list items\n   - `--copy-button-offset`: Space for copy button\n   - `--edit-button-offset`: Space for edit button\n\n6. **Animation**\n   - `--transition-speed`: Standard transition speed\n\n### Responsive Adjustments\n\nI've also added responsive variable overrides:\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  :root {\n    --font-size-base: 18px;\n    --font-size-xl: 32px;\n    --spacing-sm: 20px;\n    --spacing-lg: 30px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis allows for different values on desktop vs. mobile without changing the semantic meaning of the variables.\n\n### Benefits of This Approach\n\n1. **Consistency**: All spacing, colors, and typography follow a consistent system\n2. **Maintainability**: Change a value in one place to update it everywhere\n3. **Semantic meaning**: Variables are named by their purpose, not their value\n4. **Theming**: Easy to create alternate themes by changing variable values\n5. **Responsive design**: Adjust variables based on screen size\n\n### How to Make Adjustments\n\nNow you can easily make adjustments by changing the variable values:\n\n- To increase all button sizes: Change `--button-size` to a larger value\n- To change the accent color: Update `--color-accent` to a different color\n- To adjust spacing throughout the app: Modify the spacing variables\n- To create a light theme: Change the color variables to lighter values\n\nThis approach makes it much easier to maintain a consistent design system while allowing for quick adjustments to the overall look and feel of the application.",

Here's what I've done:\n\n### Visual Hierarchy Improvements\n\n1. **Visual Connection Between Shaders and Presets**:\n   - Added a vertical connection line between shaders and their presets\n   - Added connection dots for each preset that visually link to the parent shader\n   - Used consistent color scheme with the shader border color matching preset connection elements\n   - Indented presets to show they belong to the parent shader\n\n2. **Consistent Border Styling**:\n   - Shader items have a prominent cyan border on the left\n   - Preset items have a lighter cyan border that visually connects to the shader\n\n3. **Improved Naming for Presets**:\n   - Removed the generic \"Preset X\" label\n   - Added smart naming that:\n     - Uses the `name` parameter if available\n     - Falls back to the most distinctive parameter (e.g., \"speed: 0.5\")\n     - Uses \"Variant X\" only as a last resort\n\n### CSS Improvements\n\n1. **Added New CSS Variables**:\n   - `--color-shader-border`: For shader-specific borders\n   - `--color-preset-border`: For preset-specific borders\n   - `--preset-indent`: Controls the indentation of presets\n\n2. **Added Visual Connection Elements**:\n   - Vertical line connecting presets to their shader\n   - Connection dots for each preset\n   - Consistent border styling\n\n3. **Improved Spacing and Layout**:\n   - Better spacing between shaders and presets\n   - Clearer visual grouping\n\n### JavaScript Improvements\n\n1. **Smart Preset Naming**:\n   - Added `getPresetName()` function that intelligently names presets based on their parameters\n   - Filters out less important parameters\n   - Prioritizes meaningful parameters for display\n\n2. **Updated Parameter Filtering**:\n   - Added `name` to the list of filtered parameters to avoid duplication\n   - Simplified URL extraction code\n\nThe result is a much clearer visual hierarchy that makes it immediately obvious which presets belong to which shader, while maintaining the simplicity and usability of the interface. The connection lines and dots create a visual flow that guides the eye from the shader to its related presets.\n\nThis approach works well in dark, busy environments because:\n1. The visual connections are subtle but clear\n2. The touch targets remain large and easy to tap\n3. The naming is more meaningful and descriptive\n4. The hierarchy is immediately obvious at a glance",

Let me break down how it works with our current usage:\n\n```css\n--text-size: clamp(16px, 4vw, 24px);\n```\n\nThis means:\n1. Minimum size: `16px` - text will never be smaller than this\n2. Preferred size: `4vw` - text will be 4% of the viewport width\n3. Maximum size: `24px` - text will never be larger than this\n\nSo if we look at different screen widths:\n- On a 320px wide phone screen: \n  - 4vw would be 12.8px, but clamp enforces minimum of 16px\n  - So text stays at 16px\n- On a 500px wide screen:\n  - 4vw = 20px\n  - This is between min and max, so text will be 20px\n- On a 800px wide screen:\n  - 4vw would be 32px, but clamp enforces maximum of 24px\n  - So text stays at 24px\n\nSimilarly for our gap:\n```css\n--gap: clamp(8px, 2vw, 16px);\n```\nThe spacing will scale with the viewport width but stay between 8px and 16px.\n\nThis gives us responsive sizing that:\n- Is never too small to read\n- Is never too large to look good\n- Scales smoothly between those bounds based on screen size\n- Doesn't require media queries for every breakpoint\n\nWould you like me to adjust any of these bounds to make the text more comfortable on your devices?",
