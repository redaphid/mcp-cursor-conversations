Simplifying the activate event handler by removing the unnecessary logging callback\n3. Removing console.error and console.warn statements that were only used for debugging\n4. Replacing a console.error with a simple return statement in the fetchWithRetry function\n5. Replacing a detailed error log with a simple comment in the catch block\n\nThe service worker will now perform all the same functionality but without the verbose logging. This makes the code cleaner and more efficient, as it no longer spends resources on logging operations that aren't needed in production.\n\nThe core functionality remains intact:\n- Request caching and retrieval\n- Retry mechanism for failed requests\n- Client reloading when content changes\n- Service worker lifecycle management\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to clean up or modify in the service worker code?",
