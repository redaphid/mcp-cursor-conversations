      "text": "Looking at the service worker code, while it calls `skipWaiting()`, it's not being properly handled. The current code wraps it in `waitUntil()` but doesn't await the promise. Let me suggest an improvement:\n\n```javascript:paper-cranes/service-worker.js\n// existing code...\n\nself.addEventListener(\"install\", async (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Service Worker: Installing...\")\n    // Skip waiting and ensure it completes before continuing\n    await self.skipWaiting()\n})\n\n// existing code...\n```\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Made the event handler properly async\n2. Removed the unnecessary `event.waitUntil()` since we're awaiting directly\n3. Added await to ensure `skipWaiting()` completes\n\nThis change ensures that the service worker will properly skip the waiting phase and become active immediately. The `skipWaiting()` method returns a Promise that should be awaited to ensure it completes successfully.\n\nWithout awaiting the Promise, there was no guarantee that the skip waiting operation would complete before the service worker continued with installation, which could lead to inconsistent behavior.",

      "text": "The issue is likely because we're not properly handling the `activate` event with async/await. Similar to the install event, we should await the `clients.claim()` call. Here's the fix:\n\n```javascript:paper-cranes/service-worker.js\n// existing code...\n\nself.addEventListener(\"activate\", async (event) => {\n    console.log(\"Service Worker: Activated\")\n    await self.clients.claim()\n    console.log(\"Service Worker: Claimed clients\")\n})\n\n// existing code...\n```\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Made the activate handler async\n2. Removed `event.waitUntil()` and replaced with direct await\n3. This ensures the claim operation completes before continuing\n\nThe reason it wasn't activating is that `event.waitUntil()` wasn't properly waiting for the Promise from `clients.claim()` to resolve, similar to the issue we had with `skipWaiting()`. By making the handler async and using await, we ensure the activation process completes properly.\n\nAlso, make sure your browser's developer tools have \"Update on reload\" checked in the Service Workers section to help with testing service worker updates.",

Added logging to track the request count changes\n2. Added a `.catch()` block to ensure `inflightRequestCount` is decremented even if the request fails\n3. Added more detailed logging to help track where the count might get stuck\n\nThis should help prevent the count from getting stuck when requests are interrupted by page refreshes or failures. The logging will also help diagnose if there are still any edge cases where the count isn't being properly maintained.",
