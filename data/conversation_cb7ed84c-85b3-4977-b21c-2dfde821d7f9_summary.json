Created a `log` utility function that:\n   - Handles both string and Request object inputs\n   - Adds timestamps in milliseconds since service worker start\n   - Maintains a consistent log format: `[timeElapsed] url: message`\n3. Updated all logging calls to use the new utility function\n4. Fixed some minor formatting inconsistencies\n\nThe new log format will look like:\n```\n[123ms] https://example.com/file.js: fetching with retry\n[125ms] https://example.com/file.js: fetch successful\n```\n\nThis makes the logs:\n1. More consistent and easier to read\n2. Easier to track timing of operations\n3. More maintainable (centralized logging logic)\n4. More flexible for future enhancements\n\nThe changes have been applied successfully. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the logging format or add any additional features?",

The actual fetching and caching can happen asynchronously after `respondWith` is called\n\nThe error was happening because by awaiting the response before calling `respondWith`, we were letting the event handler finish before telling the browser how to handle the request. `respondWith` must be called synchronously (or at least before any awaits) in the event handler.",
