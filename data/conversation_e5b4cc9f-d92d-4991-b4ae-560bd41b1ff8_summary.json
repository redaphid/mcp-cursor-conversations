Created a filtered list of shaders that excludes any shader with '/wip/' in its name unless `show=all` is present\n3. Updated the render logic to use the filtered list instead of the full shaders list\n\nNow, any shader with '/wip/' in its name will be hidden from the list by default. Users can see all shaders, including WIP ones, by adding `?show=all` to the URL.\n\nThe changes follow the code style guidelines:\n- Used early returns and single-line conditions\n- Used arrow functions\n- Avoided semicolons\n- Used the latest ECMAScript features\n- Maintained the existing code structure\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?",
