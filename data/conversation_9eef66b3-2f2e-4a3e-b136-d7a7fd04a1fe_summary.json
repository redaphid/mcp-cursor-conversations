Replaced the linear threshold growth with a sigmoid function that provides a more natural, smooth expansion from the center outward.\n\n2. Changed the reset mechanism to use `smoothstep` instead of a sharp logistic function, making the transitions more gradual.\n\n3. Added a smooth falloff for the reset effect using `smoothstep(threshold, threshold * 0.8, r)` which creates a gradual transition between the center and outer regions.\n\n4. Removed the conditional blending and replaced it with a continuous blend based on distance from the center, which helps maintain visual continuity.\n\n5. Slowed down the growth rate (from 0.005 to 0.002) to make the expansion more gradual and less jarring.\n\nThe result should now show:\n- A smoother expansion from the center outward\n- No sharp transitions or jarring resets\n- Better continuity between the center and outer regions\n- A more natural, flowing animation that fills the screen gradually\n\nThe visual should now feel more organic and less mechanical, with the pattern expanding smoothly from the center while maintaining its fractal complexity.",

The visual effects maintain continuity throughout the entire animation cycle with no abrupt changes. The transitions are now much more gradual and organic, blending seamlessly between cycles.",

      "text": "I've completely revised `3.frag` to use animation functions for smoother transitions between patterns. Here are the key improvements:\n\n1. **Continuous Zoom with Animation Functions**:\n   - Implemented true continuous zoom using `pow(2.0, iTime * ZOOM_SPEED)`\n   - Added `animateEaseInOutSine(zoomFraction)` for smoother transitions between patterns\n\n2. **Animated Pattern Transitions**:\n   - Replaced basic sine/cosine with animation functions (`animateSine`, `animateCosine`, `animateEaseInOutQuad`, etc.)\n   - Added a custom `smoothTransition` function to control easing\n\n3. **Smoother Blending Between Zoom Levels**:\n   - Used `animateEaseInOutCubic` for pattern blending instead of linear transitions\n   - Reduced variation amounts between zoom levels for more subtle changes\n\n4. **Animated Visual Elements**:\n   - Applied animation functions to all pattern transformations and color calculations\n   - Created smoother rotation transitions with `animateEaseInOutQuad`\n\n5. **Consistent Pattern Generation**:\n   - Pattern parameters now change smoothly between zoom levels\n   - Added subtle variation rather than dramatic shifts between cycles\n\nThe shader now creates a continuous zooming effect with smooth transitions between patterns at different zoom levels. The animation functions ensure that changes between states are gradual and pleasing rather than jarring or abrupt.",
